In 2010, the Catfish documentary film starring Nev Schulman first coined the term&nbsp;catfishing, which can be described as a type of deceptive activity that involves a person creating a fake social networking presence for nefarious purposes. Catfish chronicles Nev’s real experiences as a hopeless romantic who falls in love online, only to discover that his romantic pursuit has more twists and turns than initially expected.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=388 data-current-count=388 data-injectable=false>Since its premiere, Catfish: The TV Show has released eight seasons so far, with more expected to follow. In that time, Nev and Max (and now Kamie) have helped form relationships and uncover the truth, journeying far and wide to make dreams come true — for better or worse. Over the years, there have been some Catfish episodes that stood out from the crowd, not often for good reasons.</p><p data-characters=71 data-current-count=459 data-injectable=true>All of these episodes, and more, can be streamed on <a href=#>Hulu</a> and <a href=#>DirectTV</a>.</p><h2 id=h-20-season-7-episode-21-sheila-rich-dollaz data-injectable=false>20.

Nev and Max introduced us to Tiana, who has been talking to James for three years after meeting him on MySpace. They were so serious that Tiana even moved to North Carolina to be with him, but as with most Catfish episodes, not everything went according to plan.</p><p data-characters=370 data-current-count=370 data-injectable=false>When Tiana and her BFF Aisha met “James,” he turned out to be Trez, the father of one of Aisha’s children. Trez turns out to be in love with Tiana. Tiana realized that Trez is the person that she fell in love with too, so they tried to make it work. As it turns out, Tiana and Trez didn’t work out, and Tiana ended her friendship with Aisha too.</p><h2 class="has-black-color has-text-color" data-injectable=false>14. Season 7, Episode 10: Dylan & Savenia</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Catfish-Dylan-and-Savenia.jpg><p data-characters=481 data-current-count=481 data-injectable=true>It isn’t too often that the alleged catfish turns out to be exactly who they said they were, but that happened to be the case with Dylan and Savenia, which touched viewers’ hearts as one of the few successful missions on Nev and Max’s part. It wouldn’t be Catfish if there weren’t some twists and turns, and although a few things seem off with Savenia, hopeful romantic Dylan continues to believe that she’s the girl he’s been talking to.</p><p data-characters=524 data-current-count=524 data-injectable=true>And that turns out to be the case, as Dylan meets Savenia in person and she confesses that her Facebook photos were altered using Photoshop and filters. She exclaims “I don’t look like that, obviously,” and Dylan responds with “Shut up, you’re beautiful.” The episode ended on a happy note, which is rare for the show, and made it one of the best episodes. As far as we know, Dylan and Savenia are no longer dating, which is a shame, but their romance made for a one-in-a-million episode.</p><h2 class="has-black-color has-text-color" data-injectable=false>13. Season 3, Episode 5: Tracie and Sammie (Jacqueline)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Catfish-Traci-and-Sammie.jpg><p data-characters=494 data-current-count=794 data-injectable=true>Actress Tracie Thoms begins to flirt with one of her super-fans, Sammie, but multiple red flags lead Tracie to seek out Nev and Max’s help in uncovering Sammie’s true identity. As it turns out, Tracie’s suspicion was well-founded, as “Sammie” turned out to be a woman named Jacqueline. In what Nev himself described as one of the “strangest” Catfish episodes of all time, Jacqueline boasts about how she bullies others online under the guise of Sammie.</p><p data-characters=296 data-current-count=296 data-injectable=false>Sadly, this is an all-too-common occurrence on Catfish and it won’t be the last time that one of the perpetrators took immense pride in their work. We have another episode up our sleeve that’s the epitome of such a situation, but without a doubt, Tracie and Sammie are a close second.</p><h2 class="has-black-color has-text-color" data-injectable=false>12. Season 5, Episode 16: Candic & Titus (Jamie)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Catfish-Candic-Ttitus.jpg><p data-characters=402 data-current-count=402 data-injectable=true>It’s a classic case of a loveless marriage; Candic feels that her husband Jamie isn’t emotionally available enough to help her deal with her problems, so she confides in Titus, a man whom she’d met on a retail app. There’s a bit of moral ambiguity about this episode since Candic does technically commit adultery, but since Titus turns out to be Jamie, the line blurs somewhat.</p><p data-characters=450 data-current-count=450 data-injectable=true>Eventually, once the truth comes out, Jamie confesses to catfishing his wife in order to reconnect with her emotionally. Candic reveals that she’d confided in Titus more than she ever had with Jamie, but her husband promises to keep the “Titus” persona going in spirit, rather than keeping the profile active. The episode was one of the most shocking, thanks to the reveal that the “catfish” was Candic’s husband.</p><h2 class="has-black-color has-text-color" id=9-season-4-episode-1-miracle-javonni-rickie-kara data-injectable=false>11.

As he claimed, Javonni was a music producer, but Miracle wanted to dig deeper to find out more. Miracle got what she wanted: the truth. Javonni was the brainchild of a husband and wife duo named Rickie and Kara.</p><p data-characters=385 data-current-count=385 data-injectable=false>As it turns out, Miracle had been talking to Kara, the wife of Rickie, and whenever she spoke to “Javonni” over the phone, it was Rickie’s masculine-sounding voice that substituted for Kara to keep the act going. Even worse, Rickie was aware of everything all along and never encouraged Kara—who victim-blamed Miracle for the whole ordeal—to stop. Not even once.</p><h2 class="has-black-color has-text-color" id=8-season-7-episode-19-mike-joey-mikey data-injectable=false>10.

In the episode, Nev and Jane take Mike to see Joey—who turns out to be Mikey—and the reveal only adds fuel to the fire. All the time that Mike was texting “Joey,” he was actually conversing with Mikey, his ex-best friend from high school.</p><p data-characters=355 data-current-count=355 data-injectable=false>To make matters worse, Mikey claimed that Mike slept with an ex-boyfriend of his at a party and he wanted to get revenge. Mikey decided to create a fake profile, find Mike on Grindr, and manipulate him to “break his heart like he broke mine.” Months later, Mike and Mikey patched things up, despite all the mistrust and deception between them.</p><h2 class="has-black-color has-text-color" id=7-season-4-episode-13-falesha-jaccqueline-tracey data-injectable=false>9.

Jacqueline had been stealing her photos for six years and using them to ruin her online reputation. Falesha, determined to track the “copycat catfish” down, seeks out assistance from the Catfish crew.</p><p data-characters=474 data-current-count=821 data-injectable=true>After some in-depth research, it becomes clear that Falesha isn’t the only victim of Jacqueline, and one of those victims shares that Jacqueline is actually Tracey. In an even weirder twist, Tracey, rather than being aloof and evasive, is perhaps the most cheerful perpetrator in the history of the show. Tracey is all smiles, and giggles, and has absolutely zero remorse for how she treated Falesha — even going so far as to say that anyone she bullies deserves it.</p><p data-characters=94 data-current-count=94 data-injectable=false>This episode was one of the most shocking, with audiences left with their jaws on the ground.</p><h2 class="has-black-color has-text-color" id=6-season-8-episode-2-alfred-adonis-anntonio data-injectable=false>8.

However, Alfred seems to find it therapeutic to unleash his blind fury with a tackle and some playground wrestling. Alfred had only spoken to his online love interest, Adonis, over text, which is already a big red fag. He asks for Nev and Max to help him uncover the mystery.</p><p data-characters=434 data-current-count=434 data-injectable=true>Alfred learns that Adonis was actually his ex-boyfriend, Antonio, who had created the account to catch him cheating and strung him along for months. After a heated confrontation, Alfred and Antonio decide to remain friends, but in a follow-up, they are seen cohabiting at Antonio’s house. According to Antonio’s Facebook page, he has been in a relationship since 2014, around the same time that he and Alfred got together.</p><h2 class="has-black-color has-text-color" data-injectable=false>7.

Nev and Max are understandably skeptical and make an attempt to convince Spencer that this scenario is highly unlikely. Spencer doesn’t want to hear any of it, continuously trying to find evidence to the contrary.</p><p data-characters=471 data-current-count=471 data-injectable=true>In a last-ditch attempt to open Spencer’s eyes once and for all, Nev and Max fly him to England to meet “Katy,” who turns out to be 18-year-old Harriet, another unapologetic catfish. She admits to impersonating Katy Perry to catfish, then when Spencer seems to have finally come to terms with it all, he contacts the Katy profile again saying he didn’t believe it wasn’t her. He even bought an engagement ring to propose to her… yikes!</p><h2 class="has-black-color has-text-color" id=5-season-4-episode-18-hundra-emily-hundra-melanie-geralyn data-injectable=false>6.

Naturally, some viewers would have seen an opportunity present itself solely to be on national television. However, no one ever thought that someone would actually go through with it. When Hundra reaches out to Nev and Max to meet Emily, her love interest, the outcome is one of the strangest yet.</p><p data-characters=422 data-current-count=422 data-injectable=true>Emily never existed and the account was masterminded by ex-girlfriends Geralyn and Melanie, who claimed to have been roped into the harebrained scheme by Hundra, who just wanted her 15 minutes of fame on Catfish and to publicly come out as gay to the world. What makes this episode even more sacred is Machine Gun Kelly as Nev’s co-host, who loses his temper when finding out that Hundra had staged the whole thing.</p><h2 class="has-black-color has-text-color" data-injectable=false>5. Season 3, Episode 2: Antwane & Tony (Carmen)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Catfish-Antwane-and-Tony.jpg><p data-characters=433 data-current-count=733 data-injectable=true>Without a doubt, one of the messiest episodes of Catfish has to be Antwane and Tony, the latter of which turns out to be Carmen, Antwane’s cousin with a vendetta. Carmen is the one who sought Nev and Max’s help to uncover Tony’s identity, but it all turned out to be an elaborate scheme to get Carmen face-to-face with Antwane in order to publicly ridicule him. This is an episode that must be seen to be believed.</p><p data-characters=361 data-current-count=361 data-injectable=false>Once Carmen comes clean, she verbally assaults Antwane, giving birth to the iconic catchphrase, “You should have never called me a fat *ss Kelly Price.” It all comes out in the open once Carmen tells Nev and Max that Antwane had body-shamed her years prior, so you’re not entirely sure who to root for, but regardless, it’s a wild ride.</p><h2 class="has-black-color has-text-color" id=4-season-7-episode-13-angel-jordan-cece data-injectable=false>4. Season 7, Episode 13: Angel & Jordan (Cece)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/catfish-angel-and-jordan.jpg><p data-characters=470 data-current-count=470 data-injectable=true>One of the common excuses for catfishing seems to be revenge; everyone wants to make others suffer in the same way they did. Season 7 gifted us with one of the most entertaining and wicked episodes of all time. Twenty-six-year-old Angel wants to find the true identity of Jordan, the man she fell in love with on Tinder. After just five months, the two planned to meet and get married. However, Angel had never spoken to Jordan on the phone nor even FaceTimed with him.</p><p data-characters=482 data-current-count=482 data-injectable=true>Moreover, Angel’s friend Cece suddenly admitted that she, too, was talking with Jordan and had developed romantic feelings for him. Nev and his wife Laura (the co-host for this episode) had already discovered that the photos “Jordan” had sent to Angel were fake. When the truth comes out, Jordan turns out to be Cece, who, in a jealous rage, wanted revenge on Angel after she repeatedly “stole dudes from her for years” and used her looks to her advantage.</p><h2 class="has-black-color has-text-color" id=3-season-3-episode-6-john-kelsey-adam data-injectable=false>3.

There were some real curveballs out of nowhere, but it made for some exciting daytime television. John meets Kelsey in an online chat room and believes that she is “the one” after chatting for months. The two have never spoken offline, but John wants to meet her. After some digging, Nev and Max discover Ellie, the girlfriend of another group member, Adam.</p><p data-characters=485 data-current-count=485 data-injectable=true>When the dust clears, Adam comes clean and says that he was Kelsey all along, chatting to Ellie on the Kelsey profile to bond with her and manipulating John to steer him away from Ellie. There was a lot to unpack in this episode, especially since Adam finds the mishaps absolutely hysterical and never truly seems genuine even after apologizing and “reflecting” on his actions. Even more messed up, Ellie stays with Adam despite knowing that he catfished both her and John.</p><h2 class="has-black-color has-text-color" id=2-season-2-episode-9-artis-jess-justin data-injectable=false>2. Season 2, Episode 9: Artis & Jess (Justin)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/catfish-artis-and-jess.jpg><p data-characters=442 data-current-count=742 data-injectable=true>Some catfish encounters can never be explained. This is the prime example of an inexplicable episode. There are too many things happening at once when Artis and Jess (actually Justin), meet for the first time face-to-face. Artis met an attractive blonde online and pursued a romantic relationship, but Jess turned out to be Justin, an internet vigilante who called Artis his “chocolate kiss,” expecting no one to find that gross.</p><p data-characters=461 data-current-count=461 data-injectable=true>There has been controversy surrounding this episode and how “real” it was, with some claiming that Justin was a hired actor who made the climax much more dramatic than it should have been. Apparently, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Justin “catfished” MTV</a>. Still, Justin denied being gay despite wanting to be intimate with Artis and never gave a clear explanation as to why he catfished in the first place. Regardless, he and Nev have some unforgettable conversations.</p><h2 class="has-black-color has-text-color" id=1-season-6-episode-3-danny-rosa-jose data-injectable=false>1.

Kind-hearted Danny meets Rosa, an attractive young woman with whom he sees himself as having a future with. When Nev, Max, and Danny set out to meet “Rosa,” the fictional sweetheart is revealed to be Jose, who could even imitate a woman’s voice to keep up the act when talking to Danny over the phone. Everyone was just as shocked as Nev and Max when Jose imitated Rosa’s voice and it sounded surprisingly convincing…and downright creepy.</p><p data-characters=370 data-current-count=370 data-injectable=false>Needless to say, the oddball episode took us on an emotional rollercoaster. Initially, Danny is in disbelief, but after some time apart, he confronts Jose and gives him guidance, even praying for him in a heartfelt moment of forgiveness and reflection. Jose seemingly is enlightened and when Nev and Max check back, Jose is much happier and has given up the catfishing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y1tMRmaWllkprAtXnEqaCsp5SawG67xWakra6jYrCiwMWiqqFlopa7rLHDaA%3D%3D</p></content><div></div><section class=sk3-margin-v-full><section class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h"><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><sk3-social><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=%2fthe-20-best-episodes-of-mtvs-catfish-ranked.html&title=The%2020%20best%20episodes%20of%20MTVs%20Catfish%2c%20ranked" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"LinkedIn","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#linkedin"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-20-best-episodes-of-mtvs-catfish-ranked.html&description=The%2020%20best%20episodes%20of%20MTVs%20Catfish%2c%20ranked" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Pinterest","width=800,height=720,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#pinterest"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-20-best-episodes-of-mtvs-catfish-ranked.html&title=The%2020%20best%20episodes%20of%20MTVs%20Catfish%2c%20ranked" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Reddit","width=832,height=624,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#reddit"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//t.me/share/url?url=%2fthe-20-best-episodes-of-mtvs-catfish-ranked.html&title=The%2020%20best%20episodes%20of%20MTVs%20Catfish%2c%20ranked" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Telegram","width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#telegram"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet/?url=%2fthe-20-best-episodes-of-mtvs-catfish-ranked.html&text=The%2020%20best%20episodes%20of%20MTVs%20Catfish%2c%20ranked" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Twitter","width=800,height=450,resizable=yes,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#twitter"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//vk.com/share.php?url=%2fthe-20-best-episodes-of-mtvs-catfish-ranked.html" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"VK","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#vk"/></svg></a></sk3-social></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><div class=sk3-margin-h><h3>Martina Birk</h3></div><div class="sk3-margin-h sk3-margin-down">Update: 2024-09-24</div></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./valery-kaufman-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-130497-html.html><h3>&lt;&lt; Valery Kaufman Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</h3></a><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./terry-crews-unveiling-the-diet-and-eating-habits-of-the-multifaceted-athlete.html><h3>Terry Crews: Unveiling the Diet and Eating Habits of the Multifaceted Athlete >></h3></a></div></div></section></section><div></div></div></div><footer class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h sk3-margin-v-full sk3-pad-v-full"><div class="sk3-pad-h txt-center-h">©
