多くのアゲ嬢がカリスマの名声を挙げましたが、
その中でも、時代が長く続いてる方といえば、
「愛沢えみり」さんです。
現在、夜の世界で働く人間であれば、
男性（ホスト）であっても知らない人はいないでしょう。
キャバ嬢としてだけでなく、
実業家としても成功してる愛沢えみりさんですが、
その交友関係は芸能界にまで及びます。
先日、自身のインスタグラムの中で、
歌手で実業家のGACKTを登場させて話題となりました。
果たしてGACKTさんと愛沢えみりさんは、
どのような交友があるのでしょうか？
愛沢えみりのインスタにGACKTが登場した理由 愛沢えみりさんのインスタにGACKTさんが登場すると、
フォローしてるファンは歓喜、
「美男美女だ」とコメントで溢れかえりました。
投稿のコメントを見てると、
GACKTさんのポーカー番組に出演したことが、
このツーショットが誕生した理由になったようです。
愛沢えみりさんをブッキングしようというセンスが、
いかにもGACKTさんらしい、斜め上をいく発想ですね！
普段からGACKTさんと愛沢えみりさんに交友があるかは不明ですが、
互いに実業家としての一面を持っているので、何かしらのパーティなどで顔は合わせてそうですね・・・。
GACKTさんといえば、過去に週刊誌に、
キャバ嬢関連のガセネタを書かれた苦い過去がありますが、
その世界（キャバクラ）のトップの方（愛沢えみり）は、
その報道を気にしてない様子です。
楽屋にキャバ嬢を連れ込んでなんちゃらとか、
自宅にキャバ嬢を監禁してなんちゃらとかいう記事ですが、
あの記事を覚えている人はいるのでしょうか？
いや、本当に信じてる人はいるのでしょうか？？笑
愛沢えみりさんも、過去に安倍総理とのツーショットを、
Snowアプリを使用して撮影してアップしたことで、
物議を醸しましたが、今回のGACKTさんにもブレずにSnowを使用してます。。笑
キャバ嬢との共演がタブー視しないGACKTさんと、
相変わらずSnowアプリで大物とツーショットが撮れる彼女と、
互いに周りの声を気にしない、メンタルモンスターな印象を受けました。
二人とも美しいというのを超えて、
かっこいいですね！
愛沢えみりのプロフィール 愛沢えみりさんの経歴に関しては、
現役キャバ嬢とは思えないほどオープンに公表されています。
やはり、モデルやタレントとしての活動も兼ねてるので、
その部分で、ある程度はホワイトなしとく必要があるのでしょうか？
生い立ちなどをハッキリ公表しながらも、
現役でナンバーワンを維持してるところが、
愛沢えみりさんの、今までのカリスマと違った部分です。

生前は１０代の教祖と言われるほどに影響力を持っていました。
現在の尾崎豊さんのイメージは”昔の人””おじさんがカラオケで歌いたがる人”という、ちょっと渋いイメージがあります。
尾崎豊さんは活動を通じて神秘さを演出するためにモノクロ写真を主体にしており、90年代まで活動していた人とは思えないほどヴィンテージ感ある印象であります。
実際の尾崎豊さんは、当時でいうジャニーズと比較できるほどに女性ファンの多いイケメン歌手でありました。
ネット上では当時の尾崎豊さんのイケメンぶりが再評価されてる風潮がありますが、まだまだ知られてない顔もあります。
今日は尾崎豊さんのかっこいい姿を、年齢や髪型で分けて紹介してみたいと思います。
尾崎豊の子供の頃。中学時代から青山学院高校。学生時代からイケメン！ 尾崎豊さんはパンクなイメージが強いですが、実は実家は勉強家が多く、ストイックな家庭環境でした。
子供の頃のエピソードを聞いてても、家族共に勉強家だったことがわかります。
尾崎豊さんは１９６５年１１月２９日に東京都世田谷区、自衛隊中央病院にて生まれました。
生まれたのが自衛隊病院だったのは、自衛官だった父親の影響です。
父は自衛官の仕事をしながら明治大学の夜間部に通い、母も大学入学資格検定のために勉強されていたそうです。
尾崎さんは、小学５年生の時、親が朝霞駐屯地に転勤し、埼玉県朝霞市に引っ越したことにともない、小学校を転校。
小学校は埼玉県朝霞市立朝霞第一小学校です。
転校先ではなかなか馴染めず、不登校の日が続くことがあったそうです。
子供の頃は、そんな尾崎豊さんにお兄さんがギターを買ってあげ、豊さんはそのギターでイルカさんや井上陽水さんの曲を歌って遊んでたそうです。
中学でギターの才能開花？以前の練馬区で楽しい青春時代 中学生になると、以前住んでた練馬区にある練馬東中学校に転校し、そこでは古い友達とフォークソング部に入り、楽しい毎日を過ごしていたそうです。
ちなみに中学生の頃はバレーボールの中田久美さんと同級生でした。
尾崎豊さんは成績優秀で生徒会長まで勤めていたそう。ギターも上手だと評判で人気者でした。
しかし、喫煙が学校にバレてしまい、停学処分を受けたこともあったそうです。
青山学院高校に進学。デビューから自主退学までイケメン！ 尾崎豊さんは青山学院高校と陸上自衛官少年工科高校、慶應義塾志木の３つを受験し、慶應以外に合格。
自衛官の学校を受験したのは自衛官である父の影響です。
尾崎豊さんは坊主にするのが嫌だと理由で、青山学院を選択しました。
高校時代の尾崎豊さんは剣道部に所属し、初段の腕前でした。
また、音楽への熱は冷めておらず、ピアノが欲しいとの理由で朝は新聞配達、夜は皿洗いのバイト漬けの高校時代を過ごしました。
剣道部で武道館に行った際にも、将来ここでライブをやりたいと心に誓い、椅子に落書きしたそうです。
ちなみに同じ高校には俳優の高橋克典さんも在学し、尾崎豊さんの1歳後輩として可愛がってもらっていたそうです。
順調に思えた高校生活ですが、高校3年生の頃に友人が一気飲みでアル中になる騒ぎに。さらには自分のグループが大学生のグループと乱闘になる騒ぎになりパトカーも出動したそうです。
その件がきっかけで尾崎さんは無期停学処分になってしまいました。
その停学期間中に尾崎さんはCBSソニーのオーディションに応募し、無事に合格。
高校三年生の1983年12月に「１５の夜」でデビューを果たしました。
その後に停学が解除されますが、出席日数が足りず留年が決まっており、尾崎さんは自主退学を選びます。
２０代の尾崎豊の美しさ。イケメン歌手の元祖？中世的な髪型が魅力！ １０代の頃の尾崎豊さんは、ザ・不良といってもいいほどワイルドな髪型でした。
２０代になると、髪の毛をストレートに垂れし、ザ・イケメンなヘアスタイルに変貌します。
実際には１０代の頃のようなワイルド系の髪型も多かったですが、この美少年風だった髪は現在でも女性ファンに人気です。
22歳になると、デニムやタンクトップなど男気あるスタイルが増えました。
無骨なファッションが増えましたが、美形が隠しきれてない感じが素敵です。
１０代の教祖とまで言われ、カリスマ性があった理由も納得ですね。
経歴、スペック、見た目、歌の才能、どれも一級品だったということです。
２０代の中盤からは、イケメン度がさらに洗練されていきました。
２０代半ばの尾崎豊のイケメン度は異常？ ↓88年の23歳の尾崎豊。私生活では結婚してます。
圧倒的に色気が増してます。
スーツがよく似合いますね！
↓89年の24歳の尾崎豊さん。私生活では第一子の息子が生まれてます。
これほど出来上がったイケメンなかないません。
↓90年の尾崎豊さん。
ファンの間でも1990年の尾崎豊さんの完成度の高さは好評のようです。
文句のつけようがないイケメンです。
↓91年の尾崎豊さん。
優しい表情も増えて、棘が少しなくなりました。
女性が一番好きそうな時期ですね。</description></item><item><title>Best of the Brunch</title><link>/brunch.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/brunch.html</guid><description>My favorite vegetarian brunch recipes!

Recommended Videos Renfield was, by many unfortunate metrics, a failure; beyond bombing at the box office with a measly $24 million gross against its $65 million production budget, it didn’t exactly sit well with critics, either, with a 57 percent approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes and an equally shameful score of 53 on Metacritic. Apparently, not even the prospect of Nicolas Cage’s Dracula could save Renfield from its fate.</description></item><item><title>George Strait Net Worth: How the King of Country Earned His Fortune?</title><link>/george-strait-net-worth.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/george-strait-net-worth.html</guid><description>George Strait is among the most successful and influential country music musicians of all time.

ラルクの実質的リーダーであり、バンドの中では最も音楽に厳しい方です。
舞台裏のエピソードなどを聞くと、
tetsuyaさんは厳しくて怖いイメージを持ちますが、
ラジオなどのメディアでのtetsuyaさんをみてると、
とても優しい性格の方だなと思います。
基本的には性格が良いと思われているtetsuyaさんですが、
それはつい最近のことで、若い頃はいろんな話がありました。
tetsuyaさんの性格が良い人なのか、悪い人なのか、
その参考になりそうなエピソードや伝説をまとめてみました。
tetsuyaの性格が良さそうな話
tetsuからtetsuyaに改名した理由 ２００９年の１２月に「tetsu」から「tetsuya」に改名しました。
デビューしてから長く「tetsu」として活動していたにも関わらず、急遽「tetsuya」に改名されたのです。
本当に長いファンからすると、今だに違和感があるそうですが、新規ファンからすると「え、tetsu？」というリアクションです。
実は、この改名した理由の１つに、ある美談が隠れているのです。
過去に長くラルクのスタッフとして活躍されていた方がいたのです。名前は通称「コメット」さんで、本名は「近藤琢哉（こんどう たくや）さんです。
ニックネーム「コメット」の由来は、”なんでも願いを叶えてくれる魔法使いみたいな人だから”ということ、バンド活動で難題にぶち当たっても、この方の努力で、なんとか乗り越えられた場面がいくつもあったからです。
裏方の雑用からなんでも積極的にこなしてきた方で、メンバーだけでなく、スタッフ、ファンからも尊敬されていた素晴らしい方でした。
その方が２００９年の１１月７日、バイク事故によって急逝してしまったのです。
亡くなってしまった後には、そのことは新聞にも取り上げられるという衝撃度でした。
tetsuさんは彼が亡くなる前、最後のライブ「TOUR2008 L’7 Trans ASIA via PARIS(DVD)」のエンディングにて、
彼の姿を映した映像を入れ、サプライズで追悼しました。
そして、tetsuさんは彼の「や」の一文字を受け継ぎ、
「tetsu」から「tetsuya」に改名されたのです。
これはあくまで一説にすぎない話ですが、多くのファンが信じていることです。
交友関係が広い tetsuさんはラルクでブレイクする前から、T.M revolutionの西川さんと友人であったり、意外な親交が多いです。
ソロ活動や、ユニット活動でもtetsuさんの顔の広さは凄まじく、同じアーティストだけでなく、多ジャンルの方まで友達になっているのです。
仮にtetsuさんが性格が悪かったら、そう簡単にたくさんの友達はできませんよね？
タバコ・ギャンブルを一切さらない ラルクといえば、ギターのケンさんが演奏中に喫煙することで知られてます。
しかし、ベースのtetsuさんは全くタバコを吸わないそうです。
さらには、ギャンブルもやりません！
旦那さんにするには、条件の良い男性なのです。。笑
性格的に、根が真面目というのが分かります。これは良い意味での真面目なのか、悪い意味での真面目なのか分かりませんが。
tetsuyaの性格が悪そうな話 番組中にブチ切れして帰った？ これは有名なエピソードですが、
１９９９年５月１日に放送された番組「ポップジャム」の中で、
tetsuyaさんが演奏の合間に怒って帰ってしまったという話。
これは都市伝説的になっていますが、
伝えられてる話と、本人談は別のようです。
当時のtestuさんはラルクが「ヴィジュアル系」と呼ばれることに抵抗があったそうですが
都市伝説では、番組のMCであった爆笑問題の太田さんが、
ラルクのことを「ヴィジュアル系」と紹介したことで、
tetsuyaさんがキレて、「HEAVEN'S DRIVE」でコーラスをしないで、
ベースをぞんざいに扱って、2曲目を演奏しないで退場、
演奏をやめて帰って中断になったとされてます。
しかし、実際は、もともと演奏される曲は別々でやりたいなど、
収録の環境で、番組と意見が合致してない部分があったそうです。
（なので２曲目をやらないで帰った理由は別にあった）
それはラルクのスタッフが番組側に、
メンバーの意思をうまく伝えてなかったことが原因で、
番組や爆笑問題の責任ではなかったそうです。
ネガティブで現実的な発言が多い
これは昔から言われていることですが、</description></item><item><title>Anna Faris Responds to Chris Pratt's Engagement to Katherine Schwarzenegger</title><link>/chris-pratt-engagement-anna-faris-reaction.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/chris-pratt-engagement-anna-faris-reaction.html</guid><description>Chris Pratt announced his engagement to Katherine Schwarzenegger this morning, and his ex-wife Anna Faris is also celebrating the news.
